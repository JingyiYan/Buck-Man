## Project Information
Buck-Man, developed by Nick Zhang, Jane Yan, Aiden Brewer, Rachel Milio, and Emily Eggers is an homage to the classic Namco arcade game Pac-Man, inspired by Bucknell University. Similar to the original Pac-Man, users navigate through a maze where they must eat pellets to gain points while avoiding the game’s villains who also traverse the screen. Our intent, however, in developing this game, was to take the easily recognizable Pac-Man game aesthetic and alter it to instead pay tribute to Bucknell.

In order to achieve this, all of the menus are blue and orange, Bucknell’s school colors. Furthermore, instead of playing as Pac-Man, a yellow circle, players play as Bucky the Bison, Bucknell’s mascot. Additionally, the levels are set in familiar Bucknell settings (Level 1 is the Malesardi Quadrangle, the center of Bucknell, and Level 2 is inside Bertrand Library, a place where Computer Science students at Bucknell spend a lot of time). Lastly, the villains of the game, which in the original Pac-Man are four multi-colored ghosts, were playfully chosen to be several Bucknell authority figures: Chris Dancy, the instructor of CSCI205; Patrick Mather, the Dean of Engineering; Amy Badal, the Dean of Students; and John Bravman, the President of the university. Beyond the aesthetic changes, Buck-Man is played the same way Pac-Man is played.

## Package Structure
Buck-Man is stored in three packages within the Main Java file. The Menu package contains the menus, while the Game package stores the actual gameplay Model, View, and Control. Lastly, the Ghost package contains the class that controls the ghosts. Additionally, graphics and media are stored in the Resource file. Information about our scrum process is in the Scrum folder, Documents for the user are stored in the docs folder, and details on our design are in the design folder.
